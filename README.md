# Gomoku React App

This is a simple implementation of the Gomoku (also known as Five in a Row) game built with React and styled-components.

## Description

Gomoku is a two-player strategy board game where the objective is to be the first player to get five of their colored stones in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 19x19 grid. Players take turns placing their stones on the intersections of the grid until one player achieves five stones in a row or there are no more empty intersections left, resulting in a draw.

## Features

- Play against a friend locally.
- Dynamic board size (19x19 grid).
- Visual feedback for placing stones and winning moves.
- Fair game detection when the board is full.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
